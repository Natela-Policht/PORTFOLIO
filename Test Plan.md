The document contains key information about testing activities. It lists all software components that will be verified and the types of tests that will be performed.<br<

## 2. Scope of tests<br>
**In scope:**<br>
- Unit tests
- Functional testing: verification of filters, field validation, and search results display
- Performance tests: average and peak response time validation
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Opera)

  **Out of Scope:**<br>
  - Automated testing (due to time and environment constraints)
  - Accessibility testing
  - Security and penetration testing
 
## 3. Test items<br>
