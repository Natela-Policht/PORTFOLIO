Expected result
Response status: 200 OK
Response body:
{
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Clementine Bauch",
    "username": "Samantha",
    "email": "test@test.net",
    "address": {
        "street": "Douglas Extension",
        "suite": "Suite 847",
        "city": "McKenziehaven",
        "zipcode": "59590-4157",
        "geo": {
            "lat": "-68.6102",

    }
}

Additional verifications:
The response email has a new value (test@test.net).
The remaining data (id, name, username, address) remains unchanged.
The response format is JSON.
The response time is < 500 ms.

The test was performed on the public JSONPlaceholder API. The endpoint returned a correct 200 OK response, but the data is not actually updated because the API is running in mock mode.
